# Lexicographical LOD draft

This repository contains a test of encoding of a few annotations found on [this text](http://tibetanverbs.soas.ac.uk/~badw/#/mdzangs_blun/129a) on [LIM](https://tibetan-nlp.github.io/lim-annodoc/).

It attempts to encode the BRAT annotations in RDF using different techniques. The result is not satisfying yet but this is a reasonable start on which a good solution can be elaborated.
